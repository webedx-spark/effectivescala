# Effective Scala

This Coursera version is currently a stub, differing from the Twitter version by only this paragraph.
For now, I am using the issue list for collecting Coursera best practice which could be incorporated
here. Note this fork, and the issue list is public, but I am including Coursera internal links into the issue list.

This is the repository for the [Effective Scala](https://twitter.github.com/effectivescala/) document. 

It is "typeset" in [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) using [PEG markdown](https://github.com/jgm/peg-markdown). It also requires the [GNU Troff suite (groff)](https://www.gnu.org/software/groff/).

## Building

To render the document:

	make
	
To publish to github pages:

	make pub
